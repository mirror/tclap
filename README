TCLAP - Templatized Command Line Argument Parser

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/t29pcolgkin1q4b8/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/salchint/tclap/branch/master)


This is a simple C++ library that facilitates parsing command line
arguments in a type independent manner. It doesn't conform exactly
to either the GNU or POSIX standards, although it is close. See
docs/manual.html for descriptions of how things work or look at the
simple examples in the examples dir.
